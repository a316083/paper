%However when smart phones has NFC function, except to grasp whether the existing use of smart phones life would more convenient or not, to pay attention to the degree of the user are expected, or are still under observation of impact. 

%In this study, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use questionnaire architectural foundation for the two influencing factors, coupled with the demand for mobile phones (dependence), the acceptance of new technology (satisfaction) and an additional fee on the use of NFC applications to an acceptable level of the three dimensions of variables. To understand the extent of changes in consumer behavior to use the Smartphoneâ€™s NFC function, and the SPSS 19.0 statistical analysis software to conduct analysis to deal with hypothesis testing. 

%The results showed that the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, level of demand for mobile phones (dependence), acceptance of new technology acceptance (satisfaction) and the use of NFC applications at an additional cost, all will positive impact on consumer behavioral intention to use the NFC smart phones.
